Thats why most of the times you can see script tags at the bottom of the html page or the body tag.

Async : It keep on executing, even the scipt is downloaded in the background, but when that script starts to getting executed, other html is not executed and after its execution , other elements are executed.
Defer : It keep on executing, even the scipt is downloaded in the background, continues executing full html and then at the last executes the script part.
